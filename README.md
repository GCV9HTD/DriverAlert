# DriverAlert

Car accident is the major cause of death in which around 1.3 million people die every year. Majority of these accidents are caused because of distraction or the drowsiness of driver. Construction of high-speed highway roads had diminished the margin of error for the driver.To prevent such accidents we propose a COMPUTER VISION approach with real-time video tracking to analyse the facial features of a driver, in particular the changes in his eyelids and head position, which are prominent fatigue symptoms. This application can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy. This kind of application's impact in an ever increasing transportation services where drivers are worked up and tired from extended hours. This could save lives, improve general transportation reliability and ensure safety.

OpenCV and DLib open source libraries are used and Python is used as a language to implement the idea. DLIB FACIAL LANDMARK DETECTOR to find the major and minor axes of eyes, as well as mouth. The aspect ratio of major to minor axes is used to determine whether eye/mouth is open; which allows for eye-state classification and yawning detection. If eyes of drivers are closed for a threshold period of time then it is considered that driver is feeling sleepy and corresponding audio alarm is used to make the driver aware.
